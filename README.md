Score Cards React Assignment

Your teacher has asked you to build the score cards for the students in your class. The data for each studentâ€™s roll#, name and marks in three subjects (Mathematics, English and Science) has been provided to you in an array named studentsInfo. 

Currently, this data has been hard-coded in individual score cards, which are being rendered into DOM. You need to remove all the cards in which hard-coded data is present and use map method to iterate over the given array to render the score cards dynamically for the given six students.
